	<h1>Biography</h1>
	<p>Yuanyuan Wang, a.k.a. YY, is a senior at Tufts who is cherishing her first snow day in 2014 such that she can sit in her not-so-cozy dorm chair and writes her first biography. </p>
	<p>She was born in the city where Tufts-In-China program is and spent the first five eighth of her life there. However she never learned of Tufts until she went to an island country on the equator &#40;1°17′N 103°50′E&#41;. In her last year there, she decided to find out if she could make a living without any financial support from her family. She started off living in the slum and taking four part time jobs at a time. Soon she found out that she could make a decent amount of money and lead a middle class life with only a high school degree. But she was not happy. She decided to escape the tropical heat and the monsoon rain. She came to Boston and had her coldest winter in life.</p> 
	<p>She is studying Civil Engineering at Tufts now. She is fascinated with mega projects and she wants to build another Burj Khalifa and the Golden Gate Bridge. She happens to know a little about programming too, even though her first encounter with Pascal when she was half of her current age was a nightmare. She sometimes feels lost because she knows too well what she wants to do. She is only three months from graduation but she still does not know where she is going to be. But she is enjoying life.</p>
